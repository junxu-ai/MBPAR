IO event trace analysis is one of the most common techniques for storage system performance analysis. In particular, block-level trace analysis is essential for storage system optimization and design, as most underlying storage devices are in block-level, even the upper-level system to users are in object- or file-level. However, there are very few tools dedicated to this topic. This tool intends to fill this gap and provide a self-inclusive contents for block-level trace analysis techniques, as well as trace parsing and result reporting techniques, based on MATLAB platform
